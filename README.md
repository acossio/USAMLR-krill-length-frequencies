# USAMLR-krill-length-frequencies
Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) length frequencies that are measured using Iaasc-Kidd Midwater Trawl (IKMT) from the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources research cruises around the South Shetland Island using 500 micro sized nets. Krill length frequencies were are also calcuated from penguin (Gentoo, Adele, or Chinstrap) diets.
Summer research cruises and penguin diet samples were undertaken Between December and the end of February. Winter cruises usually took place in August. Penguin colonies are located on Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, and the Copacabana field station on King George Island. The files are tab delimited text files.
## File names
### IKMT
IKMT files are named according to the year that they took place in, the leg of the cruise (A is the first leg and D is the second leg), then the areas that were sampled.  ie "1997A_W_EI_S_net_krill_lf.txt". 
### Penguin
Penguin files are named according to the year the sampling took place, the area where the penguin colonies are located, then the penguin species that sampled the krill. ie "2002_BS_Adele_Gen_Chin_krill_lf.txt"
## Areas
W = West Area (North of the South Shetland Islands); EI = Elephant Island Area; S= South Area (Bransfield Strait); BS = Bransfield Strait

## Data
The first column is the size of the krill measured. Then with IKMT files, the next columns are the length frequencies of Antarctic krill for the areas surveyed, according to the file name. 
With penguin files first column is the size of the krill measured. Then the next columns are the penguin species that sampled the krill, according to the file name.
